    <h1>Should the use of the Internet be monitored?</h1>
    <p>This is the home page where you can learn about the topic.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p2>We all know that the Internet has become one of the most important aspects of our lives. The internet has so many great uses, some of the most important being entertainment, and communication. But just like a lot of other powerful tools we have, It still comes with great potential and significant dangers. “Should the use of the Internet be monitored? Should it be regulated? If so, by whom and to what extent?” How and to what proportions the internet should be regulated and controlled is a very important topic in today's society, especially with the rapid growth of technology and the internet itself. Monitoring the internet and protecting users' safety and privacy definitely can help prevent any sorts of criminal activity, but if the regulations are too restrictive, they may impede on our freedom of speech and limit our rapid innovation all over the internet. It's very important for us to find the correct balance between online freedom and safety, and if regulation is required, governmental organizations have to act wisely in order to protect our freedom of speech. For my Civic engagement project I will research the question, “Should the use of the Internet be monitored? Should it be regulated? If so, by whom and to what extent?”
